# Vimeo Internship Project
Construction of Cues for Vimeo Video Player

## Conditions
An interface for the user to add Cues at certain timestamps.
- Should also list the Cues that have been added and allow them to be deleted.
- While playing the video surface the Cues at the correct times and hide after a duration.
- A Cue only needs to contain a string.
- The messages should be displayed as an overlay on the player itself.
- Only use vanilla javascript and please write all your own CSS.
- Avoid using cue point related player API methods (`addCuePoint`, `removeCuePoint`, `getCuePoints`).
- Ensure code is well documented

## Resources

- The player embed api: https://github.com/vimeo/player.js and a demo here: https://player.vimeo.com/api/demo

## Bonus Features
Not required but for fun!

- Customization, background color, width, font size, duration shown etc.
- Cues can be different types like a link, image
- Use some persistent storage.
- Allow changing the video (which should also change the Cues associated with the video).
